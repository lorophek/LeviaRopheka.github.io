			<h3>How National Unemployment Trends Compare to the Economic Experiences of Hispanic and Latino Workers</h3>
			<!-- Add image below this comment -->

			
			<p>Over the past 15 years, unemployment in the United States has risen and fallen in response to economic cycles, policy decisions and global disruptions. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics offers a broad snapshot of labor market health, but it does not always reflect how specific communities experience economic change. For Hispanic and Latino workers, unemployment trends intersect with immigration policy, industry concentration and economic inequality in ways that are often overlooked.
				<br><br>
			Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows national unemployment declining steadily during the latter half of the Obama administration, falling to historic lows during the Trump administration before spiking sharply in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Rates declined again during the Biden administration as the economy reopened and hiring rebounded. While these trends provide useful context, experts say they do not fully capture the economic realities faced by Hispanic and Latino workers.

			<h3>National unemployment provides context, not conclusions</h3>

			<p>The first visualization presents national unemployment rates across the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations. The data illustrates a long recovery from the Great Recession, a sudden pandemic-driven spike in 2020 and a gradual recovery in the years that followed.
				<br><br>
			These shifts shaped job availability nationwide, including for Hispanic and Latino workers. However, labor researchers caution against using national unemployment figures as a standalone 	measure of economic well-being.
			<br><br>
			“Unemployment is only just a singular picture of the impact of immigration enforcement,” said Mercy Loyo, a sociology Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley, whose research focuses on race, immigration, sex and gender. “The unemployment rate does not capture the number of families that have been displaced. It does not capture the number of people who feel afraid of going out.”
			<br><br>
			Even during periods of low unemployment, Loyo said many workers continue to face economic instability.
			<br><br>
			“Sure, unemployment is low,” she said, “but how many people are working that still can’t afford a one-bedroom apartment in their city?”

		<h3>Hispanic and Latino Unemployment Reflects Uneven Vulnerability</h3>

		<P>The second visualization focuses specifically on unemployment rates among Hispanic and Latino workers, highlighting how this population experienced labor market shifts across the same three administrations. While the overall trajectory broadly mirrors national trends, the data shows Hispanic and Latino workers were vulnerable during economic disruptions.
		<br><br>
		Hispanic and Latino workers are disproportionately employed in industries such as agriculture, construction, hospitality and food service sectors that are sensitive to economic downturns and were heavily affected during the pandemic.
		<br><br>
		“Oftentimes immigrants fill jobs that native-born workers are less likely to take, and these are jobs in agriculture and construction,” Loyo said. “Immigrants help the economy. The ones who work pay taxes, they contribute to their local and national circulation of the dollar in their communities. They’re not taking or reducing jobs from workers.”
		<br><br>
		Although unemployment among Hispanic and Latino workers declined during the Biden administration as hiring rebounded, researchers emphasize that recovery does not necessarily mean economic security.

<H3>Immigration enforcement and local economic effects</H3>

		Beyond national labor trends, immigration enforcement policies can shape local economies in ways unemployment data does not capture. Loyo pointed to immigration enforcement actions in cities such as Chicago, where many immigrants work as day laborers or in restaurants.
<br><br>
“I think they just make the job economy worse for everyone,” she said. “When immigrants are removed from their communities, people don’t feel safe going to other things in their community for fear that they or their loved ones could be taken by I.C.E.”
<br><br>
That fear, she explained, has ripple effects that extend beyond immigrant households.
<br><br>
“They don’t go to the grocery store. That’s money that is not being spent. They don’t go to the movie theatre,” Loyo said. “So inevitably everybody loses in those communities.”

<H3>Inequality Shapes Economic Narratives</H3>

<P>Loyo also emphasized that rising inequality has shaped how unemployment and immigration are discussed in the United States. Over the past several decades, wages for many workers have failed to keep pace with rising living costs, even as wealth at the top has grown.
<br><br>	
“We are at a time where the richest have never been more rich in this country,” Loyo said. “The divide between the rich and poor is very wide.”
<br><br>
Rather than addressing these structural challenges, she said, economic frustrations are often redirected toward marginalized groups.
<br><br>
“Rather than contending with people’s real fears,” Loyo said, “it is more advantageous for those who hold power to tell the general public that the reason their lives aren’t doing as well is because of certain groups.”

<H3>Young Latino Workers Entering the Labor Force
</H3>

<P>For younger Hispanic and Latino workers entering the workforce, unemployment data represents only one part of a broader experience. Ethan Guevara, a Latino student at Otterbein University, said he recognizes that race and ethnicity can shape career opportunities, but remains focused on building his own path.
<br><br>
“As I think about my own career, I know that I may have different opportunities just for being a Latino person entering the workforce,” Guevara said. “But overall, I know that I will drive my own success.”
<br><br>
Guevara said he hopes to create opportunities not only for himself, but for others as well.
<br><br>
“I will open up my own doors in order to become the person I want to become and help others to do so,” he said.
</P>

<H3>What the Data Leaves Out</H3>
<P>Together, the two visualizations show how national labor market trends and Hispanic and Latino unemployment rates move in similar directions, while also highlighting the limits of unemployment data. Annual averages do not capture underemployment, wage stagnation, housing insecurity or fear-driven disengagement from local economies.
<br><br>
As policymakers debate labor and immigration policy, experts argue unemployment figures should be read alongside lived experiences.
<br><br>
Unemployment numbers can look good on paper. But, they don’t tell you how safe people feel, whether families are being separated or whether people can actually afford to live.
<br><br>
While unemployment among Hispanic and Latino workers has declined since the height of the pandemic, the data suggests economic security remains shaped by more than job availability alone.
